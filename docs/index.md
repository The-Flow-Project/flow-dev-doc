# Welcome to the Flow Development Documentation

We want do document our decisions, the softwares structure, how-tos, tutorials, descriptions aso.
So everyone can have a look into the documentation, get some information, and build on it in further steps.

The **intention** is to have a good overview, follow the process, and not loosing information if someone leaves the project.

Please use the **templates** to document your work, and take the time to write it down!

This documentation won't be hosted on some server for the moment.
We update the files on the GitHub repository and after pulling the new version, we can read it locally with `mkdocs serve`.
