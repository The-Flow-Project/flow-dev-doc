# Operating Manual

The operating manual contains all necessary information and tasks to operate and manage a service, part of the project or object. It is mostly relevant for the dev team to understand, install, integrate, manage and upgrade the product.

## Typical sections of an Operating Manual

- System overview: main software components, applications, interfaces, external dependencies, host names/IP addresses (if necessary), ports/protocol and firewall rules
- Installation and onboarding:
  1. Prerequisites (specific hardware/software/server configuration and requirements, licenses, …) and check lists
  2. Step by step instructions to install software or system, e.g. how to integrate the Single Sign-On between customer’s cloud provider or on-site Active Directory, and the products user authentication module to integrate the employees
- Testing and Validation: How to check and validate the proper functionality of the system
- Information to handle typical struggles and problems
